## üöÄ What is BabySoC?

**BabySoC** is a simplified System-on-Chip model that:

- Demonstrates the core architectural elements of an SoC.
- Enables functional simulation using open-source tools.
- Bridges the gap between theoretical learning and hardware design flow.

## üß© SoC Fundamentals Covered

BabySoC helps explore and understand:

- **System-on-Chip (SoC) Basics**
  - A SoC is an integrated circuit combining CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnect on a single chip.

- **Key Components of a Typical SoC**
  - **CPU**: Central processing unit.
  - **Memory**: On-chip RAM/ROM.
  - **Peripherals**: I/O interfaces.
  - **Interconnect**: Bus structures or networks that connect the components.

- **Why BabySoC?**
  - Simplified model ideal for learning.
  - Avoids complexity while maintaining relevance to real-world SoCs.
  - Helps visualize and verify how components interact at a basic level.

- **Functional Modelling Importance**
  - Validates design logic before RTL coding.
  - Reduces chances of design errors at later stages.
  - Encourages early testing and debugging using simulations.
