# 🚀 Week 1: Linux & Git Basics for VLSI Design

Welcome to **Week 1** of my VLSI System Design (VSD) Program repository!  
This week focused on understanding **Linux basics**, **Git version control**, and preparing a smooth workflow for future VLSI tool installations.  
The goal was to build strong fundamentals in handling commands, repositories, and file organization.

| Specification       | Details        |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Operating System    | Ubuntu 20.04+ |
| RAM                 | 6 GB          |
| Storage             | 50 GB HDD     |
| vCPUs               | 4             |
